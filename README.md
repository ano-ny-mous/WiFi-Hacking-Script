## WiFi Hacking Script

This Bash script is designed to automate certain tasks related to WiFi network manipulation. It's important to note that this script should only be used for educational and testing purposes on networks you have explicit permission to access. Unauthorized use of this script is illegal and unethical.

### Features

1. **Superuser Privileges Check**: The script checks whether it is running with superuser privileges (root). It is essential to run this script as root to perform network-related actions.

2. **Disable WiFi Interface**: The script disables a specified WiFi interface (`wlx5091e31bc505` in this case).

3. **Change MAC Address**: It changes the MAC address of the specified WiFi interface using `macchanger`.

4. **Enable WiFi Interface**: After changing the MAC address, the script re-enables the WiFi interface.

5. **Run Wifite**: The script executes the `wifite` tool, which is a WiFi penetration testing tool.

### Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure the following:

- You have superuser privileges (root).
- You have installed the `macchanger` and `wifite` tools.
- The WiFi interface you want to manipulate is correctly identified (e.g., `wlx5091e31bc505`).

### Usage

1. Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x wifi_hacking_script.sh
   
2. Run the script with superuser privileges using sudo:
   sudo ./wifi_hacking_script.sh
   
Follow the on-screen instructions and be cautious when using this script, as it may interact with WiFi networks.

### Disclaimer
This script is intended for educational and testing purposes only. Unauthorized access to computer networks and systems is illegal and unethical. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to perform any actions using this script.
